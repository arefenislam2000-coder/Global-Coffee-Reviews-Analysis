# Global-Coffee-Reviews-Analysis

This repository covers the complete pipeline for analyzing global specialty coffee reviews — from **web scraping** and **data cleaning/transformation** to creating interactive visualizations using **Tableau**.

##  Overview

- **Web Scraping**: Collects coffee review data (e.g., from coffee review sites) using Python and Jupyter notebooks.
- **Data Processing**: Cleans, transforms, and prepares the scraped data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Leverages Tableau to explore coffee ratings, origins, and other insights interactively.
